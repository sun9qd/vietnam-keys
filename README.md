# vietnam-keys
Arduino as keyboard for vietnamese special characters

Prerequisites:
- Arduino UNO or MEGA2560
- Display shield 320x240 Colour-TFT-LCD with Touch for Arduino, e.g Iduino TF028

Project Idea:
- The vietnamese language uses a lot of special characters not available on a non-vietnamese keyboard.
- The arduino can be used as a keyboard extension for your standard keyboard - i.e. a second keyboard for the special vietnamese characters (both keyboards being used simultaneously).
